| # | Job | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3e427cb2 | PASS. She walks toward camera pulling the phone out, golden hour, jacarandas. |
| 2 | a6555611 | PASS. Head down, grey chat, "¿Qué pasó con NVIDIA?" exact, grey lorem answer unrolling. |
| 3 | 9378b1cd | FAIL. Headline exact and crowd posture right, but the model read "grey faces" as surgical face masks: the whole crowd is masked (pandemic look). Redo with explicit "no masks". |
| 4 | 579b1b01 | FAIL. Head up and green light on her face are right, but the phone shows its BACK to camera, so the real Bobby screen is not visible. Redo over the shoulder with the screen toward camera. |
| 5 | a6627171 | PARTIAL. Headline, frozen grey card, chips ENTRAR / ESPERAR / NO HAY TRADE + 18:32 timestamp all correct. Byte lost its hoodie and reads as a green astronaut with a helmet. Redo pinning the hoodie / shorts / sneakers. |
| 6 | bcc18368 | PASS. Lockup "Bobby" / pill "Únete a la lista de espera" / "bobbyprotocol.xyz/app" exact; she walks away, Byte translucent one step behind. |

Lesson: with nano_banana_pro, "faces lit grey" → masks; say "faces bare, no masks, lit from below by the screen". Element refs keep identity of humans and locations very well (char_cdmx is the same woman in all 6). A stylised mascot element drifts toward a generic figure unless its costume is spelled out again in the prompt.

| 5 | 38824c1b | PASS. Byte keeps hoodie/shorts/sneakers as a translucent green spirit, hand raised, grey card dissolving, chips ENTRAR / ESPERAR (lit) / NO HAY TRADE + 18:35. Minor: she looks down at the phone instead of at Byte. `storyboard/f5-r2.png` |

Review sheet: `storyboard/review-r2.jpg`. Technique validated; the Spanish set is now superseded by the decisions below.

## Decisions 2026-09-03 (Anthony, after seeing rounds 1–2)
- Audience is English: all on-screen text and both voice lines in EN.
- Two formats: 9:16 Instagram, 16:9 Twitter/X + LinkedIn (restage after the 9:16 set is approved).
- Protagonist younger: same face as char_cdmx, ~21. Reference sheet job de5f779a (2 cr) → Element `char_cdmx_young` 60ad2f20-1705-4e5c-917d-680ddd8c47aa. `storyboard/char_cdmx_young-sheet.png`, comparison `storyboard/young-vs-original.jpg`.

| 3 | 33e35942 | FAIL. Masks came back despite "NO face masks" (the "lit from below by the screen" phrasing seems to trigger them). Redo without the glow, with "mouth, nose and chin uncovered". |
| 4 | ab0c5258 | FAIL. Screen shows an invented Bobby UI (Android-style robot, "LEARN IN PUBLIC") instead of the referenced screenshot. Redo with "reference placed inside the phone pixel for pixel". |

| 3 | 01ab6fc6 | PASS. No masks, all heads down, she is the only head up, "ChatGPT answers." exact. `storyboard/en/f3-r4.png`. Fix that worked: drop "lit from below by the screen", say "mouth, nose and chin uncovered, nobody wears a mask, scarf or bandana". |
| 4 | 63897869 | PARTIAL. The screen is now the real Bobby Live Desk (Byte, DESK ONLINE, cards, mic) with "What happened with NVIDIA?" in the input, but the phone is oversized and frontal. `storyboard/en/f4-r4.png` |

Credits spent on this film: 12 + 6 + 2 + 12 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 40 (balance ≈ 2,984).

## Next (needs Anthony's go)
1. 16:9 restage of the six frames (Twitter/X, LinkedIn): ~12 cr.
2. Seedance 2.5 omni_reference 9:16 15 s with the six frames as image references, EN dialogue in the prompt: 720p ≈ 97.5 cr (preflighted), 480p cheaper (verify). Then 16:9 the same way.

## Anthony's frame-by-frame notes on the first approved set (2026-09-04)
1. Body slightly out of proportion (height). 2. Phone is flipped (screen faces camera while she reads it).
3. Good composition but she looks at the sky, not at the people. 4. She must look at the phone while speaking.
5. OK. 6. Byte must face the same direction she walks, so they read as together.

Credits spent on this film so far: 40 + 10 = 50 (balance ≈ 2,974).

## Anthony's notes on set v2 (2026-09-04)
1. Body proportion still off and no people. 2. Good, but reads as a different street. 3. Almost: bring back the grey
people, she should look slightly to her left; paving colour must match across frames. 4. Perfect but looks like another
street. 5. Same street as 4, but reads as another place. 6. Her and Byte slightly bigger.
Root cause: location continuity. Fix: pass the approved frame 3 (job 2b0a06ef) as image reference in every frame
("exact same sidewalk, same paving stones, same median, same facades").

| 3 | 347c2531 | PASS. Grey pedestrians back, she looks slightly to her left, amused; "ChatGPT answers." |

Lesson: for a multi-frame storyboard, pick one approved frame as the LOCATION reference and pass it as image_references to every other frame with "exact same sidewalk, same paving stones, same median, same facades, same light". Elements alone do not hold the street.

Credits spent on this film so far: 50 + 12 = 62 (balance ≈ 2,962).

## Anthony's notes on set v3 (2026-09-04): only two frames
1. Move her slightly further back (reference: his crop of frame 1). 5. Headline must use the same typeface/size as "ChatGPT answers." in frame 3.

## Pre-video checklist (Higgsfield docs, 2026-09-04)
- Seedance 2.5 generates ambience, foley, music and speech in the same pass (`generate_audio` true by default; v1 mp4 has an AAC stereo track). Dialogue goes in the prompt as quoted lines per shot.
- Schema (CLI `model get`): modes t2v / omni_reference / video_edit / video_extension; ≤ 50 reference items total; 480p / 720p / 1080p; duration 4–30 s; `audio_references` accepted (use for Bobby's real app voice later).
- Higgsfield's own advice: prototype cheap, lock the prompt, then final. Costs preflighted 9:16 15 s with audio: 480p 37.5 · 720p 97.5 · 1080p 135 (no-audio same price).
- The preset recommendation ("IN THE DARK", 24bae836) must be declined with `declined_preset_id` for a literal render.

All six shots in order and on time; every locked string exact (ChatGPT answers. / Bobby checks / the market first. / Bobby / Join the waitlist / bobbyprotocol.xyz/app); same street throughout; Bobby screen on the phone in shot 4; Byte appears at 9 s, grey card dissolves, chips card present; lockup holds 12–15 s. Audio track present with clear level changes at the dings (3–6 s) and the voice lines (7–8 s, 9–11 s); speech content NOT machine-verified (no local STT), Anthony to listen. Nits: shot 1 she is closer to camera than frame 01; Byte turns to face camera for a beat at 12 s before walking beside her; chat bubble text at 2 s too small to verify at 480p. |

Credits spent on this film so far: 70 + 37.5 = 107.5.

## Anthony's feedback on video V1 (2026-09-04)
Opening shot good but needs audible CDMX ambience (birds etc.); crowd must walk in her direction, not stand; she must say the question out loud while typing ("What's happening with the market?"); show that everyone asks (second line after "ChatGPT answers." and/or an insert); drop NVIDIA, ask about "the market" (ban risk when naming a stock).

Pending decision before video V2: wording of the second line after "ChatGPT answers." and whether to add a 1-second insert of another pedestrian's phone (hands only, no face).

Good: crowd walks with her in every wide shot; "the market" wording; insert of hands + phone with the grey answer at ~4.5 s; Bobby screen; Byte + chips + "Bobby checks / the market first."; lockup exact. FAIL: the second line did not render: instead of "Like it does for everyone." the model stacked a second (partly garbled) "ChatGPT answers." under the first from ~5.5 s to 7.5 s. Also "ChatGPT answers." starts a beat early, over the end of the phone shot. Byte still turns to face camera for a beat at 13 s. Audio: track present; speech not machine-verified. |

Credits spent on this film so far: 113.5 + 37.5 = 151.

## Anthony's feedback on video V2 (2026-09-04): screen direction
Front / behind / front / behind reads as going and coming back. Fix in script v3.2: never cross the axis; POV for the phone shots; frontal for Bobby; rear view only after she passes the camera in shot 6.

AXIS FIXED: frontal walk → POV typing → wide (crowd walking with her) → POV Bobby screen → frontal Byte → she walks past camera → rear view with Byte beside her, Byte never faces camera. Lockup, "Bobby checks / the market first.", Byte, chips all good. FAIL again: "Like it does for everyone." did not render at all (the model will not swap a headline inside one shot; it just kept "ChatGPT answers."). Minor: "ChatGPT answers." still starts ~0.5 s early over the end of the POV shot. Audio present; speech not machine-verified. |

Credits spent on this film so far: 157 + 37.5 = 194.5.

## Anthony's feedback on video V3 (2026-09-04)
- "Like it does for everyone." must be SPOKEN by a second voice (female, clear General American, matter-of-fact) and shown; it is the problem statement.
- Her face in the wide shot looks AI.
- No keyboard on screen while she types → reads as AI.
- Show the prompts in chat; use Higgsfield's prompt structure (his PDF: Cinematic Car Commercial breakdown).
- NO credits without explicit authorization per run (V3 was launched without one — my mistake).

Result V4: BEST SO FAR. "Like it does for everyone." finally renders, alone, on the stranger's-hands insert (5.5–7 s); keyboard visible in the typing POV; Bobby POV with mic; Byte + chips + "Bobby checks / the market first."; she passes the camera and the rear view with Byte beside her holds to the lockup; axis clean. ONE regression: "ChatGPT answers." also appears over cut 1 (0–1.5 s) before the typing POV, then correctly again on cut 3. Audio present; speech not machine-verified. Credits spent on this film so far: 202.5 + 37.5 = 240.

## Anthony after V4 (2026-09-04)
Locked: everything up to second 4. Remove the grey-sweater insert (reads as a wardrobe change). "Like it does for everyone." stays in the context of shot 3 (her walking) → closer cut of the same walk (frame 3b). Crowd = four distinct voices. Bobby POV must keep moving, not a still. He caught that frame 3b had "ChatGPT answers." baked in → regenerate with the right line.

Anthony spotted a duplicated pedestrian (same man, grey polo + backpack, twice) in V4's Byte cut → v5 prompt now forbids duplicated extras in the TECHNICAL BLOCK and in cut 6.

## Video round 5 — 2026-09-04 · AUTHORIZED ("Dale") · seedance_2_5 omni_reference · 9:16 · 15 s · 480p · audio · 37.5 cr
Job c596e224 → `renders/promo-v2-9x16-v5-480p.mp4`, contact `renders/contact-v5-480p.jpg`. Prompt: `prompt-9x16-en-v5.txt`. Refs: bcd1e573, 22503d32, e0a4fa4b, fcc257c6, 4e8a52fd, 2fb27bff, 84641206, de5f779a, a9d0e9eb.
Result V5: PARTIAL. Good: no text in cuts 1–2 (fixed); keyboard; "ChatGPT answers." only from the wide cut; Bobby POV; Byte + chips; pass-by + rear view + lockup. FAIL (third time): the second line did not render — cut 4 (closer, on her) still shows "ChatGPT answers." even with the line baked into its storyboard frame; also that closer cut crops her head at the top edge. Byte cut: the grey-polo man appears left and a similar man right; not clearly distinct. Conclusion: Seedance keeps the first headline whenever the following cut looks like the same scene; the only time the second line rendered (V4) it was on a visually different insert. Audio not machine-verified. Credits spent on this film so far: 242 + 37.5 = 279.5.

## Cut-4 clip — 2026-09-04 · AUTHORIZED ("Autorizo los 10 créditos") · seedance_2_5 omni_reference · 9:16 · 4 s · 480p · audio · 10 cr
Job 0cf64545 → `renders/cut4-clip-480p.mp4`. Separate render of the closer cut with "Like it does for everyone." baked in the still (fcc257c6) + second voice; to be spliced into V5 at 5.8–7.6 s with ffmpeg. Prompt: `prompt-cut4-clip.txt`.
Cut-4 clip result: PASS. "Like it does for everyone." on every frame, she walks with her whole head in frame, extras walking behind. Spliced locally with ffmpeg (V5 0–5.1 s + clip 0–2.5 s + V5 7.6–15.04 s, hard cuts, re-encoded x264 crf 18 + aac 160k) → `renders/promo-v2-9x16-v5-assembled-480p.mp4` (15.08 s). Credits spent on this film so far: 279.5 + 10 = 289.5 (balance ≈ 2,735).
Method note: when Seedance refuses to change a headline between similar cuts, render that cut as a separate clip with the text baked into its still and splice in edit (the Higgsfield tutorial assembles scenes the same way).

## Text-only fix on V4 (post, no credits) — 2026-09-04
Anthony: the spliced clip changed the pace; he only wants the second line added at the same moment, same sound, same effect. Built `renders/promo-v2-9x16-v4-textfix-480p.mp4`: video = V4 0–5.5 s + V3's wide shot 5.5–6.9 s (same framing, she keeps walking) with a PNG overlay "Like it does for everyone." (Arial Bold 24, white, soft shadow) placed under the baked "ChatGPT answers." from 5.75 s + V4 from 7.6 s (Bobby POV); audio = V4 0–6.9 s + V4 7.6 s onward (0.7 s of the insert's tail dropped). 14.33 s. Known seam: at 5.5 s the cut from V4's wide take to V3's wide take is a small jump (she is a bit further, the headline sits lower). ffmpeg has no drawtext here → text rendered with PIL as `renders/overlay-line2.png` and applied with `overlay`.

Result V6 16:9: PASS on review. No text in cuts 1–2; keyboard visible; "ChatGPT answers." on the medium shot with the official extras in colour; "Like it does for everyone." RENDERS on the close-up (same context, blue hoodie + beige jacket behind her); Bobby POV alive; Byte + chips + two-line headline with people in colour; pass-by → rear view with lockup "Bobby / Your best friend in the market. / Join the waitlist / bobbyprotocol.xyz/app". Nit: "ChatGPT answers." lands ~0.3 s early over the tail of the typing POV. Audio not machine-verified (Bobby's new line, four crowd voices, second voice). Credits spent on this film so far: 486 + 37.5 = 523.5.
Anthony on V6 16:9: "casi perfecto"; only fix: in cut 3 SHE speaks, but it must be the people around her who ask (each with their own voice/lips) while she listens. Prompt v6 cut 3 updated accordingly (v6.1).

Result V6.1 16:9: PASS on review. Same structure as V6; in cut 3 her mouth stays closed while she glances at the four pedestrians (their lip-sync not verifiable at 480p; audio to be checked by Anthony). Everything else identical: keyboard POV, close-up "Like it does for everyone." with the official extras, Bobby POV, Byte + chips + headline, pass-by, lockup with tagline.

Result V6.2 16:9 (17 s): mostly PASS. Whisper now has room (grey answer unrolls only at ~3.5 s) and "ChatGPT answers." lands with the medium shot at 4.0 s, not before; close-up line renders; Bobby POV; Byte cut shows 2–3 distinct extras (no obvious clones); the 1.5 s empty-street breath exists (13.0–14.5 s) and the rear view + lockup follows (14.5–17 s). NEW NIT: the cut-6 headline "Bobby checks the market first." stays on screen through the pass-by and the empty street (12.2–14.5 s) instead of ending at the cut. Audio (full whisper, four voices) to be checked by Anthony.

Anthony on V6.2: remove the two men on the right in cut 3 (they vanish in the next cut, looks odd); in cut 6 the world freezes when Byte appears (people stop walking) → must keep moving; last scene is good.

All texts correct. Audio to be checked by Anthony.
Anthony on V6.4: up to 8 s perfect; 9–12 s she does not look at Byte (must turn to HER LEFT, Byte is screen-right = her left; my prompt said "right shoulder"); the empty-street shot at 12 s reads as nonsense → removed. Prompt v6.5: `prompt-16x9-en-v6-5.txt`.

Walk, keyboard POV, "ChatGPT answers." medium with the two extras, Bobby POV, Byte cut with her looking at Byte, rear view with the lockup CENTERED above them (the model centered it on its own). ONE FAIL: the close-up (6–7.5 s) shows "ChatGPT answers." instead of "Like it does for everyone." (the old headline-persistence problem is back in vertical). Fix for a vertical final: a 9:16 storyboard still for the close-up with the line baked in (2 cr) or the separate-clip splice.
